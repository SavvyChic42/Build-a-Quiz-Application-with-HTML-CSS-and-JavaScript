Quiz applications are a fantastic way to engage and entertain users on websites. Whether you want to test knowledge, provide educational content, or simply offer a fun activity, building a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent choice. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of creating a quiz application from scratch.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional quiz application that you can customize to fit your specific needs. We will start by setting up the HTML structure, where we'll define the layout and elements required for the quiz. Then, we'll move on to designing the user interface using CSS, making the application visually appealing and engaging.

Next, we'll dive into the JavaScript implementation, where we'll handle the logic behind displaying questions, capturing user responses, and calculating the score. JavaScript will be the backbone of our quiz application, allowing us to dynamically generate content, validate user inputs, and provide interactive feedback.

Throughout this tutorial, we'll provide code snippets, examples, and clear explanations to help you understand each step of the process. Even if you're a beginner to web development, don't worry! We've designed this guide with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for anyone looking to improve their front-end development skills.

So, Let's start making an amazing quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript step by step.<br>

Step 1 (HTML Code):<br>

To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our quiz application.<br>

After creating the files just paste the following codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.<br>

Here is an explanation of each element:<br>

<!DOCTYPE html>: This is a declaration that specifies the HTML version being used, in this case, HTML5.<br>

<html>: The root element of an HTML document. It encapsulates all other elements on the page.<br>

<head>: This element contains metadata and other information about the web page that is not directly displayed on the page itself.<br>

title>: This element sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.<br>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: This line links an external CSS stylesheet file named "styles.css" to the HTML document. It is used to apply styles to the elements on the page.<br>

<body>: The main content of the web page is placed within this element.<br>

<div class="container">: This <div> element acts as a container for grouping and organizing other elements.<br>

<h1>Quiz App</h1>: This <h1> heading element displays the text "Quiz App" as the main heading of the web page.<br>

<div id="quiz"></div>: This <div> element with the id attribute "quiz" will serve as a placeholder for dynamically generated quiz questions.<br>

<div id="result" class="result"></div>: This <div> element with the id attribute "result" and class attribute "result" will be used to display the quiz result.<br>

<button id="submit" class="button">Submit</button>: This <button> element with the id attribute "submit" and class attribute "button" represents a button labeled "Submit." Users can click this button to submit their quiz answers.<br>

<button id="retry" class="button hide">Retry</button>: This <button> element with the id attribute "retry" and class attribute "button hide" represents a button labeled "Retry." It is initially hidden (hide class), and will be displayed when the user wants to retry the quiz.<br>

<button id="showAnswer" class="button hide">Show Answer</button>: This <button> element with the id attribute "showAnswer" and class attribute "button hide" represents a button labeled "Show Answer." It is initially hidden (hide class), and will be displayed to allow users to see the correct answers.<br>

<script src="script.js"></script>: This line includes an external JavaScript file named "script.js" that contains the logic and functionality for the quiz app. The JavaScript code will be executed when the browser encounters this script tag.<br>

This is the basic structure of our quiz application using HTML, and now we can move on to styling it using CSS.<br>
